      <p>Pot of Cha means Pot of “Tea” in Chinese.  We are passionate about bringing tea leaves directly from our growers from Nantou, a province in central Taiwan and jasmine green tea leaves from Vietnam.  With quality tea leaves, we blend them into unique and delicious signature beverages.  Pot of Cha brewing method involves high quality tea leaves, clean water, proper tea containers, and the right temperature for each of our premium tea. Even before brewing, the tea process (from growth to drying tea leaves) is also a key component in producing quality teas.  During the process of roasting the tea leaves, we closely monitor the temperature and the cooking time to ensure natural fragrant taste of each type of tea leaves.  We are dedicated to delivering consistent quality and genuine customer experience “one customer and one cup at a time” and to providing the “Pot of Cha experience” through our innovative approach of rediscovering the diversity of handcrafted teas and tradition of teas.</p>
